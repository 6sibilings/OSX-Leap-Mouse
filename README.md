# OSX-Leap-Mouse
==============

This is a mouse emulator using the Leap Motion API.
The project aims to be as intuitive as possible.

* When a hand is recognized its id is used to track only this hand
* The finger with the shortest distance to the display is used

#### Open an issue for features that should be implemented!

## Please contribute!

This started just as a "five-minute-project" and is therefore incomplete.

## The Leap SDK

The Objective C files of the SDK are included. The SDK itself isn't necessary. 
The files are taken from the Leap SDK 0.7.6.
